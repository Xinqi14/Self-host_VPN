# Self-host_VPN
This is the cheapest and easiest way to use Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Google services in China or some places banned these services.

# The self-host VPN is cheaper than famous VPN providers like ExpressVPN and NordVPN. 

# Here are some of the benefits of self-hosting a VPN:
Privacy: When you use a self-hosted VPN, your data is encrypted and routed through your own server before it reaches the internet. This means that your ISP, government, or other third parties cannot see what websites you are visiting or what data you are sending and receiving. You hold your own logs.
Security: A self-hosted VPN can provide an additional layer of security for your online activities. For example, you can use it to access public Wi-Fi networks without worrying about your data being intercepted.
Anonymity: If you are concerned about your online privacy, a self-hosted VPN can help you to remain anonymous. This is because your IP address will be hidden from the websites and services that you visit.
Control: When you self-host a VPN, you have complete control over the service. This means that you can choose the software that you use, the level of security that you want, and the features that you need. You hold your own logs. You also can control where you want your IP address to present. 

# However, there are also some drawbacks to self-hosting a VPN:
Complexity: Setting up and maintaining a self-hosted VPN can be complex. If you are not familiar with networking or server administration, you may need to hire someone to help you.
Downtime: If your server goes down, your VPN will be unavailable. This can be a problem if you rely on your VPN for work or personal use.
Banned: Surfing the Internet with VPN might cause your social media account to get banned. For example, Meta will ban your account to protect it. Because in their view your account will travel all over the world. Last second, your IP is in Japan. Next second, your IP is in the US.
Overall, self-hosting a VPN can be a good option for users who are looking for a high level of privacy, security, and control. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before making a decision.
